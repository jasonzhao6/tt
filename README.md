# Tomato Timer (TT)

A ruby script that announces 'X minutes in.' every 5 minutes.

I use it as a subtle reminder to focus and be aware of time passing.

This was inspired by and a poor man's version of https://www.centered.app/.

## HOW TO:

In a terminal, run `[/path/to]/tt.rb [do this one thing]`.

When you are done, exit with `ctrl + c`.

- or

In `.bash_profile`, add `alias tt='[/path/to]/tt.rb'`.

Then in a terminal, run `tt [do this one thing]`.
